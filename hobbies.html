    <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
    
    <h2>Rowing</h2>
    <p>Last year one of the captains said I should join. Being a freshman I decided why not, I'll join! 
    It is so much fun! I have made great friends and stayed active during my time at college.</p>

    <h3>Video Games</h3>
    <p>My dream is to help make my favorite games. 
    I grew up playing games like Animal Crossing and Mario Kart. I want to share the joy I get from playing these games with others.</p>

    <h4>Music</h4>
    <p>I like listening to kpop. It's kinda embarassing.... But it is just pop music with Korean lyrics. My favorite bands are IVE and Stray Kids. I have seen both groups in concert!</p>

    <h5> Favorite Songs and Lyrics</h5>
    <p>My Pace (Stray Kids)</p>
    <blockquote>
잊지마 My speed, My lane, My pace
조급할 필요 없어 My Pace
비교 따윈 하지 마
천천히 달려도 괜찮아
나의 길을 따라 My lane
급한 맘 내려놔
앞만 보고 달려가
You ready, let's go
</blockquote>
<p>Easy (Stray Kids)</p>
<blockquote>Come and watch me now 언제라도 난
I'ma make it look, make it look, look so easy
Come and watch me now 어디서든 다
당황할 거야 할 거야 it's so easy
</blockquote>
<p>I Am (IVE)</p>
<blockquote>I hope you'd be someone's dreams come true (yeah)
Life is 輝くgalaxy (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Be a writer ジャンルなら fantasy
明日へと開くbig, big stage
So that is who I am
</blockquote>
<p>Off the Record (IVE)</p>
<blockquote>Love me, love me
어서 날 Leave me, leave me
날마다 Killing healing
또 외쳐 난 Stay</blockquote>
<p>Be Alright (IVE)</p>
<blockquote>It's gonna be alright
Don't worry about tomorrow
弾ける emotion
心配いらない
It's gonna be alright
超えてゆく想像
さあおいでよfollow
I know it's gonna be
It's gonna be alright (Alright)
